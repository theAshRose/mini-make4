## About

Here we have a wonderful, wonderful weather app. This app delivers weather data to the user for a selected city. [Here is a link to the application](https://thedomconrad.github.io/weather-reader1/)
A user may view todays weather along with a 5 day forecast.

## Why?


## How to use

Simply enter the name of the city and click "submit". The current weather along with a 5 day forecast will be displayed! You may keep entering cities and a list of clickable buttons will aggregate on the left. You may revisit selected cities' weather at any time and if you refresh the page your list will persist! Enjoy :)

## the Code!
The most challenging part of LivHealthy for the team was learning and implimenting new technology on the fly. 
Below is an prime example of that: Chart.js implementation. We not only managed to sucessfully impliment Chart.js according
to project goals, but managed to add functionality above and beyond what was required. This, we are proud of, so enjoy our code snippet of Chart.js updating AND saving data for the user - while allowing user input only to clear said data.

```
        $("#homeNutrients").on("click", "#eat-me", function (event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        updateChartData(event);
});

    console.log($("#homeHealthScore"));
    const myChart = new Chart(document.getElementById("myChart"), config);

    updateChartData() {
        let storedChart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("storedChart")) || [0 ,0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
  
        let calories = storedChart[0];
        let fat = storedChart[1];
        saturatedFat = storedChart[2];
        let carbohydrates = storedChart[3];
        let sugar = storedChart[4];
        let protein = storedChart[5];

    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[0] = calories += parseInt(
        $("#homeCaloriesLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[1] = fat += parseInt(
        $("#homeFatLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[2] = saturatedFat += parseInt(
        $("#homeSatFatLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[3] = carbohydrates += parseInt(
        $("#homeCarbsLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[4] = sugar += parseInt(
        $("#homeSugarLi").text()
    );
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data[6] = protein += parseInt(
        $("#homeProteinLi").text()
    );

    storedChart = myChart.data.datasets[0].data
    localStorage.setItem("storedChart", JSON.stringify(storedChart))
    myChart.update();
}

    $(document).ready(function () {
        let storedChart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("storedChart")) || [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
        myChart.data.datasets[0].data = storedChart;
        myChart.update();
    })

    $("#delete-me-chart").on("click", function (event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    let storedChart = [0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0]
    myChart.data.datasets[0].data = storedChart
    localStorage.removeItem("storedChart")
    myChart.update()
})
